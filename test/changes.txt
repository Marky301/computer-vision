START SERVER:
1) Start test/main.py
2) Start hand_tracking_client.py

HOW DOES IT WORK?

main.py calls the main_window.py and widgets to create the window. A socket is created and data is collected from hand_tracking_client.py
and send to test_commands.py. Data is then processed in test_commands.py.

mostly everything to do with creating the lines and spheres and labels on the GUI is on test_commands.py.

I took out gesture recognition for the time being since it was annoying to deal with during testing. Will add it back in the morning
